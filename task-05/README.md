for adding the background image in search_window i copied the code from main code(Qmovie)
for api integration i refered to a code i found online for api integration

for dialogue box i found documentation online

for new_window i found the copied the code from the search_window for the class part and then i made a few changes accordingly

for the buttons i again used the code in the search_window and then i changed the position and size through trial and error

i used QPixmap to display the images, opened the pokemon_photos folder and then i make a list of the pokemon names of the pokemons available in the folder
i iterated and then used it to achieve the expected result


i could not upload the poke_env file in the github repository
