Hackerrank Tasks:

Captain Room_1:
i used dictionary to keep track of how many times a number has occured and then i printed the key which has a value of 1

Captain Room_2:
the room numbers are allocated in order so i just printed the number which is greater than the number of number of people divided by the number of people per group(so i get the number of rooms already allocated to the passangers)

Decoding_digit_frequencies:
I initiated a dictionary with values 0
I iterated through the given string input and then when there is an occurance of a digit, i 1 to the value
finally i print it by converting the values to a string seperated by spaces

Missing_numbers;
I solved this using Dictionaries, i kept track of the number of times a number has occured and then i changed the values of dictionary a to be same as the number in difference of occurances, then i print out the keys as a string seperated by spaces.

Power_Combinations:
I first initiated a matrix squares and used a loop to find the sqaures till the number by root of the power asked
for this question i used a similar logic to the one in TwoSum question of leetcode.
I used recursive function to iterate and find all the possibilities and then find all the possible options and note them in number_of_combinations
then i finally took the inputs and called the function


Grid_lock:

I solved this code using the lengths of the spaces, i tracked the spaces using a for loop to iterate through each string row of the given input
I used the Same with the inverted form of the input,
then i maped the word to the proper spaces
then i finally printed the code
