I am willing to put in the hard work and dedicate the hours.

What are your fields of interest?
I like to grasp and hone new technical skills, as i am curious about the world around me, this goes beyond the technical aspects, i like to watch documentaries, listen podcasts and read journal blogs.
I like to shoot videos (basically vlogs but just for me and my peers to watch, supposed to be stored as memories).
